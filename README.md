### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pieter van der Westhuizen, a freelance web & mobile developer from Pretoria, South Africa. I've been slinging code for more than 25 years in a variety of technologies and industries.

I'm currently working on building mobile and web applications for clients using Flutter, Vue, C#, SQL Server, Cosmos DB and Mongo DB. Mix in some AWS, Firebase, Supabase and/or Azure and you have some magic.
